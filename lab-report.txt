Lab Report

From this lab we have learned about:
  - The actor and graph model of design that is used for the computation of
    three different things (sum, max, and min). This includes how the nodes
    fire and how they wait for tokens as a result of previous
    actors firing. 
  - We found it very interesting how the logical flow of data only allows
    some actors to fire at specific times, depending on the input data. 
  - It was also interesting to see how with minimal changes, we could
    implement the three different functionallities across the code. Once
    we figured that out everything became much easier.

Design
  - The design was largely based of the design that was given to us in the
    inner product example. we basicallly took that code and modified that 
    so it would work with the histogram implementation that we become so 
    familiar with over this past semester. 
  - The only difference in the three implementations is a few lines of code
    in the accumulator verilog module

Testing
  - We have 5 different testing modules that test five different 
    functionalities of the code specified in the lad write up that we were
    given.
  - Testing reqires input tokens that specify the command, the length, 
    and the data that is being input into the system

Debugging
  - Debugging the model was very easy since there
    were no issues that we had other than linking the correct files to the 
    files in the src directory. Once we figured that out it 
    was very easy to debug everything.
  - In addition, most of the dubugging required changing the syntax
    of the different files. as long as we kept the correct names 
    throughout we were sucessful
